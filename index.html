			    <p>My dream is to use my imagination through the medium of technology to create joy in the lives of others. Laughter is the cure of my life, and I want to bring that to the common person. In today’s society, there is always a fix for something, whether it's a new startup service or a self-help book. Sometimes I think the constant push for advancement has hidden the simplest beauty in life that can’t be calculated, confused, or even improved. 
			    </p>
			    <p>I try to model my personal, professional, and spiritual life after the minimalist perspective. Some of my biggest professional inspirations have come from the works of Apple and Pixar. Outside of programming, I love to read, travel, and learn. I have grown up in the South my whole life, and permanently reside in Atlanta, GA. However, I have spent the past two summers in San Francisco and Seattle, where both have been fruitful experiences. Life is an adventure, and I welcome tomorrow's challenges with a smile.
