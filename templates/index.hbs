	    <p>My dream is to use my imagination through the medium of technology to create joy in the lives of others. Laughter
	       is the cure of my life, and I want to bring that to the common person. My inspirations come mainly from the vision of two companies, Apple Inc. and Pixar Animation Studios. If you choose to explore more of this site you will definitely see Easter eggs from each of them. 
	    </p>
	    <p>Therefore, I created this website to express the joys of my life - writing and programming. The tabs are the different areas of my persona that I thought were interesting enough to share. Some articles are on my favorite books, recently seen movies, and places that I've traveled. Hopefully as I experience more of this world each of the tabs will collect more articles. The iBrad page elaborates on my technical background.
